# Lunch Orders
# It's approaching lunch hourâ€¦ let's collect orders. 
#Create a new file called lunch_orders.rb to complete this exercise.

# Create a program that collects lunch orders. Prompt:
# Name for order: (enter name)
# {name} wants to order: (enter item)
# Store the name/order data. When storing data, do it in such
# a way that additional order items may be added for the 
#person's name.
# Example: Greg can order a Burger, and then add Fries to his 
#order later.
# After storing data, prompt the user with:
# Add another item to the order? (y/n)
# Repeat steps 1 & 2 if the answer is "y"
# After the user completes adding orders, print out:
# "All orders: {order data}"
# Keep going...
# Rather than printing out a blob of raw lunch order data,
# print each name's orders on a separate line, formatted as 
#one of the following:

# "Greg ordered a sandwich"
# "Peter ordered a burger & fries"
# "Travis ordered a salad, apple & water"
# You may have to do some hunting in Ruby docs!

# bob = {
#     :item1:"a",
#     :item2:"b"
# }
# answer = ""
# name = ""

# orders = Hash.new(0)
# print "Name for order: "
# name = gets.chomp
# print "#{name} wants to order: "
# item = gets.chomp
# orders = {[name][:item1] => item}
# #orders[name][:item1] << item
# puts "Add another item to the order? (y/n)"
# if answer == "y"
#     puts "What else would you like?"
#     gets item.chomp
#     name[:item2] << item
# else puts "Have a nice day and see you next time!"
# end
